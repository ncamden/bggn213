## 1. Introduction to the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB)
# Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

169,916 out of 196,979 total, about 86%.

#Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

most of them! 171,351 out of 196,979 total, about 87%

#Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

22,183

# Reading and working with structyres in R

The `bio3d` package for structural bioinformatics has a lot of features for reading and working with biomolecular sequences and structures.
```{r}

library(bio3d)
pdb <- read.pdb("1HSG")
pdb

```


```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```


Normal mode analysis (NMA) is a bioinformatics method for predicting functional motions. It will show us the parts of the protein that are "flexible" (i.e. the most dynamic).
```{r}
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```

Make a "movie" of this thing moving.
```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_nma.pdb")
```

# Comparative analysis of all ADK structures

First, we get the sequence of ADK and use this to search the PDB database.
```{r}
aa <- get.seq("1ake_a")
aa
```
Run a blast search of the PDB database using this sequence
```{r}
blast <- blast.pdb(aa)
#blast
```

examine the results
```{r}
hits <- plot(blast)

```
download all the ADK structures in the PDB database
```{r}
hits$pdb.id
```

```{r}
#pdb.annotate(hits$pdb.id)
```

```{r}
# Download related PDB files
files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=TRUE, gzip=TRUE)
```
Viewing all these structures looks like a mess.
We need to try something else...

We will align and superimpose these structures.

```{r}
library("BiocManager")
pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE, exefile="msa")
#pdbs
```

```{r}
# Vector containing PDB codes for figure axis
ids <- basename.pdb(pdbs$id)
```


```{r}
# Draw schematic alignment
plot(pdbs, labels=ids)
```

## PCA to the rescue...
```{r}
pc.xray <- pca(pdbs)
```
and plot my results
```{r}
plot(pc.xray)
```

```{r}
# Calculate RMSD
rd <- rmsd(pdbs)
```


```{r}
# Structure-based clustering
hc.rd <- hclust(dist(rd))
grps.rd <- cutree(hc.rd, k=3)
```


```{r}
plot(pc.xray, 1:2, col="grey50", bg=grps.rd, pch=21, cex=1)
```
